Exercise 1: Basic Abstract Class
Create an abstract class Shape with:
 
An abstract method calculateArea(): number
A constructor that takes color as a property
A method getColor(): string that returns the color
Then, create two subclasses Circle and Rectangle that implement calculateArea().
 
Task
Implement Shape, Circle, and Rectangle
Create instances and call the methods

Answers:

abstract class Shape {
    constructor(private color: string) {}
  
    abstract calculateArea(): number;
  
    getColor(): string {
      return this.color;
    }
  }
  

  class Circle extends Shape {
    constructor(private radius: number, color: string) {
      super(color);
    }
  
    calculateArea(): number {
      return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
    }
  }
  
  // Rectangle subclass
  class Rectangle extends Shape {
    constructor(private width: number, private height: number, color: string) {
      super(color);
    }
  
    calculateArea(): number {
      return this.width * this.height;
    }
  }
  
 
  const circle = new Circle(6, 'Red');
  console.log(`Circle Color: ${circle.getColor()}, Area: ${circle.calculateArea()}`);
  
  const rectangle = new Rectangle(3, 8, 'Blue');
  console.log(`Rectangle Color: ${rectangle.getColor()}, Area: ${rectangle.calculateArea()}`);
  

  














Exercise 2: Implementing an Interface
Create an interface Vehicle with:
 
A property speed: number
A method move(): void
Then, implement Vehicle in two classes: Car and Bicycle.
 
Task
Implement Vehicle, Car, and Bicycle
Create instances and call the move() method

Answers:

interface Vehicle {
    speed: number;
    move(): void;
  }
  

  class Car implements Vehicle {
    constructor(public speed: number) {}
  
    move(): void {
      console.log(`The car is moving at ${this.speed} km/h`);
    }
  }
  
  
  class Bicycle implements Vehicle {
    constructor(public speed: number) {}
  
    move(): void {
      console.log(`The bicycle is moving at ${this.speed} km/h`);
    }
  }
  
  const car = new Car(140);
  car.move();
  
  const bicycle = new Bicycle(24);
  bicycle.move();
  

















Exercise 3: Combining Abstract Class and Interface
Create an interface Flyable with:
 
A method fly(): void
Create an abstract class Bird with:
 
A property name: string
A method eat(): void
Then, create two classes Eagle and Sparrow that extend Bird and implement Flyable.
 
Task
Implement Bird and Flyable
Create Eagle and Sparrow and call eat() and fly()

Answer:

interface Flyable {
    fly(): void;
  }
  
  abstract class Bird {
    constructor(public name: string) {}
  
    abstract eat(): void;
  }
  
  class Eagle extends Bird implements Flyable {
    constructor(name: string) {
      super(name);
    }
  
    eat(): void {
      console.log(`${this.name} is hunting for food.`);
    }
  
    fly(): void {
      console.log(`${this.name} is soaring high in the sky.`);
    }
  }
  
  class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable {
    constructor(name: string) {
      super(name);
    }
  
    eat(): void {
      console.log(`${this.name} is pecking at seeds.`);
    }
  
    fly(): void {
      console.log(`${this.name} is flying around the trees.`);
    }
  }
  
  
  const eagle = new Eagle("Eagle");
  eagle.eat();
  eagle.fly();
  
  const sparrow = new Sparrow("Sparrow");
  sparrow.eat();
  sparrow.fly();
  













Exercise 4: Interface Inheritance
Create two interfaces:
 
Person with name: string and speak(): void
Employee (extends Person) with salary: number and work(): void
Create a class Developer that implements Employee.
 
Task
Implement Person, Employee, and Developer
Create an instance and call speak() and work()

Answer:

interface Person {
    name: string;
    speak(): void;
  }
  
  interface Employee extends Person {
    salary: number;
    work(): void;
  }
  
  class Developer implements Employee {
    constructor(public name: string, public salary: number) {}
  
    speak(): void {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
    }
  
    work(): void {
      console.log(`${this.name} is coding and working on projects.`);
    }
  }
  
  const developer = new Developer("Tom", 80000);
  developer.speak();
  developer.work();

Advanced example
 
Exercise 1: Abstract Class for Banking System
Create an abstract class BankAccount with:
 
Protected properties: accountNumber, balance
Constructor to initialize accountNumber and balance
Methods:
deposit(amount: number): void (increases balance)
Abstract method withdraw(amount: number): boolean (returns true if successful, false otherwise)
Method getBalance(): number
Then, create two subclasses SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount that:
